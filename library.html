        <h2>Project Contribution</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Developer</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Developed a comprehensive library management system to manage book inventory, member records, and lending transactions. Implemented features for searching, borrowing, and returning books, with user authentication and role-based access control.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Libraries often struggle with manual tracking of books, loans, and user information, leading to inefficiency.</p>
        <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> I developed a web-based system using the following technologies:</p>

        <!-- Technologies Used -->
        <ul class="technology-list">
            <li>HTML5 & CSS3 for front-end design</li>
            <li>JavaScript for interactive components</li>
            <li>Node JS for the back-end</li>
            <li>MongoDB for database management</li>
            <li>Bootstrap for responsive design</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Final Result:</strong> The system reduced library staff time spent on management by 40%, increased user satisfaction, and improved overall efficiency.</p>
