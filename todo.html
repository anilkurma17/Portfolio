        <h2>Project Contribution</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Developer</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Created a task management application to help users keep track of their daily tasks and goals. The app features task creation, editing, and deletion, as well as categorization and due dates. Included user authentication and data persistence using a backend server.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Managing tasks across multiple platforms and devices can become chaotic and unorganized.</p>
            <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> I focused on creating a streamlined, cross-platform application:</p>
            
            <!-- Technologies Used -->
            <ul class="technology-list">
                <li>Used <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to build the app’s layout and make it user-friendly.</li>
                <li>Implemented <strong>Local Storage</strong> to allow users to access tasks without internet connection.</li>
                <li>Added reminders and priority levels using <strong>JavaScript</strong> to help users organize their tasks better.</li>
                <li>Applied <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to ensure the app looks good on all devices (phones, tablets, and computers).</li>
                <li>Created a drag-and-drop feature so users can easily move tasks around.</li>
            </ul>
            

        <p><strong>Final Result:</strong> The app significantly improved task management efficiency and was well-received for its seamless synchronization and user-friendly interface.</p>
